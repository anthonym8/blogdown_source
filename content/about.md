I'm an engineer with experience in both research and industry in the fields of semiconductors, telecommunications, and computer vision. My primary interests include data science, artificial intelligence, and their practical business and social applications.

Previously, I was a product engineer at Maxim Integrated where I analyze product specs, functionality and manufacturing data among others. Here, I formulate analytical models that explain the physical-electrical relationships that translate semiconductor variability to manufacturing yield and operating costs.

I'm in permanent beta mode and currently locked in to expanding my data science skills while I pursue new opportunities. You can reach me through this profile or through email at rey.masilang@gmail.com. Also, check out my blog at r-mas.github.io/blog.
